# Unified-Loan-Intelligence-Dashboard-Suite-Power-BI
Designed a comprehensive dashboard suite for a lending organization to monitor KPIs, understand borrower behavior, and analyze granular loan data.


1. üîç Overall Problem Statement: Unified Loan Insights Platform

The lending organization currently lacks a centralized analytics solution that brings together high-level performance tracking, borrower behavior insights, and granular loan-level data. Data is siloed across multiple tools and reports, leading to delayed decisions, inefficient analysis, and missed strategic opportunities.

To address these issues, a three-tiered dashboard ecosystem is being proposed:

Dashboard 1 focuses on high-level KPIs (Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Repayments, etc.) with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trend tracking.

Dashboard 2 explores borrower demographics, regional variations, and behavioral segmentation through visualizations.

Dashboard 3 offers a detailed, grid-style interface with full loan and borrower data for case-level review.

Together, these dashboards aim to provide a 360-degree view of loan operations, enabling smarter decisions, faster actions, and deeper insights.
