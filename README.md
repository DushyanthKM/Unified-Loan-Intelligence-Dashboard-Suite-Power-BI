# Unified-Loan-Intelligence-Dashboard-Suite-Power-BI
Designed a comprehensive dashboard suite for a lending organization to monitor KPIs, understand borrower behavior, and analyze granular loan data.


1. üîç Overall Problem Statement: Unified Loan Insights Platform

The lending organization currently lacks a centralized analytics solution that brings together high-level performance tracking, borrower behavior insights, and granular loan-level data. Data is siloed across multiple tools and reports, leading to delayed decisions, inefficient analysis, and missed strategic opportunities.

‚úÖ [1] Background (Your Version)
Background
A leading lending institution in India is on a mission to improve visibility into its loan portfolio, borrower behavior, and financial performance. The institution receives thousands of loan applications monthly and needed a better way to track KPIs, identify trends, and ensure data-driven decision-making.

To enable this transformation, the team proposed building an interactive Power BI solution with tailored dashboards that offer a clear view into lending trends, repayment behaviors, borrower segmentation, and overall financial health.
